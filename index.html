<p>My name is Wesley Jones, everyone calls me Dice. I'm a double amputee quadriplegic. I've been paralyzed since 2015 after being gunned down three times at a peace gathering
     down in Florida. In 2016 I bought a laptop and the equipment that I could use to be able to use a computer since then I have came a far away of understanding the ends and outs of a computer. Now I'm  pursuing a career in web developing. My passions are traveling , music , skydrivng and making dreams come true.I am self motivated. I don't let my disability get the better at me.</p>
